      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ratna Kirti</strong>, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Knox College. Over the years, I have immersed myself in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including CUDA, Elixir, OpenMPI, Docker, SQL, Haskell, Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. My versatility allows me to adapt to different languages seamlessly, but my true passion lies in web development.</p>
      <p>One of my proudest achievements is developing a website for a perfumery business, <a href="https://deoexoticattarandperfume.com/" target="_blank">Deo Exotic Attar and Perfumes</a>, which supports global payments and has significantly enhanced the business's online presence.</p>
      <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable industry experience as a Server Administrator Intern at the Irrigation and Water Resources Department. This role has honed my skills in server management and provided me with a deeper understanding of the practical applications of my studies.</p>
      <p>I am always eager to collaborate with others on innovative projects and contribute my expertise to a dynamic team. Whether it's building robust web applications, managing servers, or exploring new programming paradigms, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to the possibility of working together!</p>
